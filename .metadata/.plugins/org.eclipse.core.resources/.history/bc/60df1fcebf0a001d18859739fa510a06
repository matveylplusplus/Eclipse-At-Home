		//Now, to explain typing beyond just the surface, we have to ditch the words "compile-time type" and "run-time type" a little bit. 
		//"Parent" indicates that the COMPONENT TYPE of all elements is Parent. This is like a contract that says "okay, all my elements' compile-time types must be exactly this type or lower in the inheritance path (if component type is an object), and if not, I'm going to complain." It is regulating the ELEMENT TYPES, which is specific to each element and composed of element-specific compile-time and run-time types. So in this case, we are declaring that the element type of every element must have compile-time type Parent or Child.
		
		parray = new Parent[3];//instantiates array object whose elements all have the compile-time type Parent. This follows the contract set by the component type earlier. 
		System.out.println(parray);//parray's reference value is now initialized to point to array object in heap, whose elements are initialized to default values because the JLS says so (Section 4.12.5). Because elements were declared as compile-time type Parent (a reference type), and the default value for a reference type is null, every element is initialized to null. Thus, no run-time type exists for any of these elements as of this point as the objects themselves don't exist
		print1D(parray);//prints [null|null|null]
		
		Object obj = parray;//this is legal btw. even tho an array isnt a class at all. read Section 10 of JLS
		
		parray[1] = new Parent();//instantiates Parent object and tells its reference value to overwrite parray[1]'s null reference. run-time type of parray[1] therefore becomes Parent
		System.out.println();
		print1D(parray);//prints [null|immutable.Parent@1ce92674|null] *hash codes obviously change every time this is run*
		parray[0] = new Child();//instantiates Child object and tells its reference value to overwrite parray[0]'s null reference. run-time type of parray[0] therefore becomes Child
		System.out.println();
		print1D(parray);//prints [immutable.Child@6fd02e5|immutable.Parent@1ce92674|null]
		
		parray = new Child[3];//instantiates array object whose elements all have the compile-time type Child. This also follows the contract set by the component type earlier. 
		print1D(parray);//prints [null|null|null]
		System.out.println();
		
//		parray[1] = new Parent();//causes run-time error; parray[1] wants to have run-time type Parent but compile-time type of ALL elements was already set as Child in line 34. 
		parray[0] = new Child();//instantiates Child object and tells its reference value to overwrite parray[0]'s null reference. run-time type of parray[0] therefore becomes Child
